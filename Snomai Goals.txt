[] PRIORITY SEVEN
    [] Look into possibly checking for cuts with another library and autiomating the whole process. Might be possible but I need to research it. Something like this https://pypi.org/project/scenedetect/

[] Auto clip gathering for when the well dries up.
    [] Most people don't even care about the vertial format if it is cut right so I don't need to clean it uptoo much. Reddit is probally best place to grab these new clips.
